## TODO
- Perks - ways to make the game more engaging during the problem
	- some way to assess progress on question? like a progress bar which you can use to see how your opponent is doing
	- ways to sabotage your opponent? maybe once per game you can generate random chars in opponents code to hinder their progress
	- push notification when an opponent does something, like run a successful test, write x lines of code, etc.
- Option to rematch from chat room
- Script / scraper to constantly update CSV of LeetCode questions
- Ability to filter by topics, not just difficulty
- elo rating + leaderboard (may require implementing authentication)
